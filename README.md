## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the structure, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.  
EDA is a critical step in the data science pipeline to clean, visualize, and understand the data before modeling.

---

## âœ… Tasks Performed

- Imported essential libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`
- Displayed initial structure using `head()`, `info()`, `describe()`
- Handled missing values and cleaned the dataset
- Removed irrelevant or redundant columns
- Generated summary statistics for each feature
- Created the following visualizations:
  - Histograms
  - Correlation Heatmaps
  - Scatter Plots
  - Pairplots
- Analyzed feature relationships to assist future modeling

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Graph Insights

- **Histograms:**  
  Showed the distribution of key numeric features â€” some were skewed, indicating the need for scaling or transformation.

- **Correlation Heatmaps:**  
  Helped identify highly correlated variables which may introduce multicollinearity.

- **Pairplots:**  
  Provided a visual understanding of how features interact, and highlighted potential clustering patterns.

- **Scatter Plot (Age vs Fare):**  
  Revealed that younger passengers generally paid lower fares, though outliers were present.

- **Age Distribution:**  
  Majority of the individuals were between 20 and 40 years, indicating a younger population.
